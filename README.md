# BADS-2017
2nd Symposium on Breakthroughs in Advanced Data Structures  
This is a seminar about the theme "[A General Framework for Dynamic Succinct and Compressed Data Structures](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611974317.14)"
for [Patrick Klitzke, Patrick K. Nicholson](http://epubs.siam.org/author/Nicholson%2C+Patrick+K)
## Theme: A General Framework for Dynamic Succinct and Compressed Data Structures.

In the original [paper](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611974317.14)
the authors describe the implementation of two succinct data structures: **Range Tree** and **AVL Tree** for the efficient 
representating of static and dynamic data structures. These succinct data structures have an interface for applying any 
popular compression Algorithms and they benefit also of the operations that offer their building blocks structures (BFS 
Breath First Search).

### Why this Github?
Here is the code of the **Range Tree** and **AVL Tree**. Note that the code here ist not an implementation but a further explanation 
of the two data structures describe in the original paper.  
This is a Web-App tha permit to the reader of the paper other my seminar to see graphically the data structures. The reader can create
for example a range tree and perform all possible operations (rank, select,modify, access) over it.
